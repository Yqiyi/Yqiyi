abstract: The Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) is a direct consequence of the weak law of large numbers (WLLN) which plays a vital part in the proof of Shannon's source coding theorem regarding the source sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables (RVs). In this paper, we show that the AEP also holds in the non-stationary memoryless regime where the sequence of RVs is independent but not necessarily identically distributed (i.n.i.d.). This more general result is called the i.n.i.d.-AEP. We then generalize this result to the i.n.i.d.-joint AEP that considers two sequences of i.n.i.d. RVs. A modified version of the i.n.i.d.-joint AEP called i.n.i.d.-distortion AEP with a time-varying distortion measure is also introduced. Based on the i.n.i.d.-AEP and its generalizations, we present two applications: the non-stationary source coding theorem and the non-stationary information embedding theorem. Specifically, the proof of the non-stationary source coding theorem entails the i.n.i.d.-AEP, while the proof of the non-stationary information embedding theorem mainly depends on the i.n.i.d.-joint AEP and the i.n.i.d.-distortion AEP.
